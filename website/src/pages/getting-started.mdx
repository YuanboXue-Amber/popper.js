# Getting Started

Popper can be installed in two ways.

## 1. Package Manager

```sh
# npm
npm i @popperjs/core

# Yarn
yarn add @popperjs/core
```

In your application, import the `Popper` module:

```js
import Popper from '@popperjs/core';
```

This assumes you're using a module bundler like webpack, Rollup, or Parcel.

## 2. CDN

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@popperjs/core@2"></script>
```

Once the script is loaded, `Popper` will be available on the global `window` object.
